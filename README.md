This one time we built an application. The suits argued about colors. 
They picked something 'pretty'.
Then we had to build a second app for accessibility.

Let's not do that. Let's build from the ground up for accessibility.

## Accessibility?
If you don't know what it means, congrats. You're probably not:

- colorblind **or**
- blind/low vision **or**
- don't have a cognitive impairment **or**
- don't have motor and/or situational impairment **or**
- don't have friends or family that have usability issues

For many other users, applications and websites are difficult to use because the colors don't have enough contrast, the navigation is unusable, the interface can't be navigated with a keyboard or the application doesn't support screen readers.

# 508, ADA, WCAG, wut?
Multiple standards exist to make digital services available to people with disabilities. As usual...there's an XKCD for that.

<h1>It boils down to this:</h1>

**508** - says digital services maintained by the ***federal government*** shall be accessible

**ADA** - says digital services maintained by the ***businesses, state & local governments, and nonprofit orgs*** make accomodations for the disabled public

**WCAG** - a bunch of smart people got together and said "we know people **need** to access stuff, but no-one has said **how** to develop it. Let's roll"

Conveniently, WCAG meets all the requirements of ADA & 508, so that's what we'll focus on...that's on which we will focus. Whatever.
